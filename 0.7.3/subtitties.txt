Subtittles.
Val1 = Subtitles (Will not include "")
Val2 = Subtitles Colour.
---

Typing "//" in Val1 before the rest of
the subtitle will not make a new line
and will instead update the current line.

if Val2 == "clear" then all subtitles get cleared out.
^^^ This is regardless of what is typed into Val1.
