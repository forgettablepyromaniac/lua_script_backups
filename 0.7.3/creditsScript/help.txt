tl;dr:
put lua in scripts folder
either make a file called "allSonsInfo.txt" in the data folder or use the python script
information in the thing
profit

[Song Folder Name]
Song Name::Song Creator::Song Name Colour::Song Creator Colour::Box Colour::Background Colour::How Long it Stays

use the python script in the data folder or specify in the arguments when running the file.
"python3 makeAllSongsInfo.py -h" tells you basically the same thing
