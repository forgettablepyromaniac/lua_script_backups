# lua_script_backups
Various Psych Engine Lua Script Backups

You will need to edit some of these heavily if you want to use them in your own mods.

SO to everyone who helped me code shit up (RedstoneRuler especially), and the LSE discord.

# version support
I've fixed this up by putting the version the script has been tested in inside of its own folder
0.6.3 might work on 0.7.1h and vice versa, but i never tested them so that's what you get.

Every script I put up here goes underneath this license (see LICENSE)
Things that are in this repo but do NOT count under this license:
- Sounds (.ogg)
- custom_time.zip (inside of 0.6.3, this was from SEEK'S COOL DELTARUNE MOD)
- strumline_hammerhead.lua, strumlineAnims.lua/.txt (inside of 0.6.3, these were from THIRD STRUMLINE REWRITE)
- Set Camera State.lua/.txt, Play Animation (Player 3).lua/.txt (inside of 0.6.3, these was by RedstoneRuler & not me.)

^ The things listed here have slight edits from me, but were not made in whole by me, and are therefore not mine
so they're not underneath the license.

IF YOU'RE TOO LAZY TO READ:
For this license, it's basically just "give me credit if you base anything off my scripts".
"My scripts" refer to everything in the repo that is not in the list above.
