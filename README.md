Various Psych Engine Lua Script Backups

You will need to edit some of these heavily if you want to use them in your own mods.

SO to everyone who helped me code shit up (RedstoneRuler especially), and the LSE discord.

# version support
I've fixed this up by putting the version the script has been tested in inside of its own folder
0.6.3 might work on 0.7.1h and vice versa, but i never tested them so that's what you get.
