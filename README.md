# lua_script_backups
Various Psych Engine Lua Script Backups

You will need to edit some of these heavily if you want to use them in your own mods.

SO to everyone who helped me code shit up (RedstoneRuler especially), and the LSE discord.

# version support
I've fixed this up by putting the version the script has been tested in inside of its own folder
0.6.3 might work on 0.7.1h and vice versa, but i never tested them so that's what you get.

# i dont get how licesnes work

So this will be the catch-all part of the repo:

PLEASE GIVE ME CREDIT IF YOU USE MY SCRIPTS IN A MOD/USE THEM AS A BASE FOR YOUR OWN,
UNLESS THEY'RE IN THE LIST BELOW, THEN PLEASE CREDIT THOSE PEOPLE INSTEAD.

things that are in this repo but were not made by me, just tweaked.
- Sounds (.ogg)
- custom_time.zip (inside of 0.6.3, this was from SEEK'S COOL DELTARUNE MOD)
- strumline_hammerhead.lua, strumlineAnims.lua/.txt (inside of 0.6.3, these were from THIRD STRUMLINE REWRITE)
- Set Camera State.lua/.txt, Play Animation (Player 3).lua/.txt (inside of 0.6.3, these was by RedstoneRuler & not me.)
